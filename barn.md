# Barn

This seems like the most complicated system I have in mind, because I have 380 V
machines in the barn that seems like they will be harder to support on a battery
bank than grid power.

Maybe they make good enough inverters to make this real or maybe I will end up
replacing these machines with 230 V counterparts as they are all old and it is
possible that nowadays you can get just as capable tools that don't require a
380 V outlet.

## Sizing

I want to power these machines and tools, barring any replacements that will not
require wall power (battery-powered tools):

- table saw
- band saw
- planer
- plasma cutter
- laser cutter
- angle grinders
- log splitter
- wood chipper
- garden tool outlet (lawnmower, strimmers)
