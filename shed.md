# Shed

I'm looking at getting a garden shed built and it seems like a prime opportunity
to install solar and test out an island system.

## Sizing

The shed roof will be 7x4 m so 28 m2.
I want to power the following appliances with the system:

- lights (internal and external)
- outlets (chargers and tools)
- fridge
- water heater / boiler
- space heater / heat pump
- water filter
- cameras
- network

In order to make this system a reality, I will need to build the shed, but also
to calculate the expected peak and sustained load of the above listed appliances
and see if it would be possible to install enough panels to be able to cycle a
battery daily and whether the battery bank would be able to support the loads.
