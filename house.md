# House

I don't intend on installing house solar myself.
I would like to get a company to do it, but do it by the time I have gained
enough knowledge and experience with solar that I'll be able to oversee the
work and make sure I am not getting ripped off.
Also, I think I will end up sourcing the panels and the batteries myself.
This will most likely be a 48 V system.
The goal is to make this an island system, I don't like the idea of grid-tie.
