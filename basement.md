# Basement

I am tracking the electrification of the house in [House][#house], but I think
it might make sense to isolate the basement as a system of its own and DIY it
separately from the house itself.

The reason is that while I don't want to install the panels on the house myself,
I will likely do it on the shed and the shed array might be able to generate
enough power to support both the shed and the basement.

If that ends up the case, the basement system could exist much sooner than the
house system and be completely independent of it both electrically and in terms
of construction.

## Sizing

I want to power the following appliances with the system:

- lights
- ventilation
- dehumidification
- well pump
- washer
- dryer
- fridge
- freezer
- sensors (temperature, humidity)
- cameras
- heat pump?
